## Practice Problems

1. Import [this file](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/launchschool/sql_course_data/master/sql-and-relational-databases/schema-data-and-sql/group-by-and-aggregate-functions/films4.sql) into a database.

   ```shell
   $ psql -d lesson_2 < films4.sql
   ```

   

2. Write SQL statements that will insert the following films into the database:

   | title           | year | genre     | director          | duration |
   | :-------------- | :--- | :-------- | :---------------- | :------- |
   | Wayne's World   | 1992 | comedy    | Penelope Spheeris | 95       |
   | Bourne Identity | 2002 | espionage | Doug Liman        | 118      |

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO films (title, year, genre, director, duration) VALUES ('Wayne''s World', 1992, 'comedy', 'Penelope Spheeris', 95);
   INSERT INTO films (title, year, genre, director, duration) VALUES ('Bourne Identity', 2002, 'espionage', 'Doug Liman', 118);
   ```

   

3. Write a SQL query that lists all genres for which there is a movie in the `films` table.

   ```sql
   SELECT genre FROM films GROUP BY genre;
   ```

   

4. Write a SQL query that returns the same results as the answer for #3, but without using `DISTINCT`.

   ```sql
   SELECT genre FROM films GROUP BY genre;
   ```

   

5. Write a SQL query that determines the average duration across all the movies in the `films` table, rounded to the nearest minute.

   ```sql
   SELECT round(avg(duration),0) FROM films;
   ```

   

6. Write a SQL query that determines the average duration for each genre in the `films` table, rounded to the nearest minute.

   ```sql
   SELECT genre, round(avg(duration)) AS average_duration
   	FROM films
       GROUP BY genre;
   ```

   

7. Write a SQL query that determines the average duration of movies for each decade represented in the `films` table, rounded to the nearest minute and listed in chronological order.

   ```
    decade | average_duration
   --------+------------------
      1940 |              102
      1950 |               93
      1970 |              144
      1980 |              112
      1990 |              114
      2000 |              116
      2010 |              133
   (7 rows)
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT (year / 10 * 10) AS decade, round(avg(duration)) AS average_duration
   	FROM films
   	GROUP BY decade
   	ORDER BY decade;
   ```

   

8. Write a SQL query that finds all films whose director has the first name `John`.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM films
   	WHERE director LIKE 'John %';
   ```

   

9. Write a SQL query that will return the following data:

   ```psql
      genre   | count
   -----------+-------
    scifi     |     5
    comedy    |     4
    drama     |     2
    espionage |     2

    horror    |     1
    action    |     1
   (8 rows)
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT genre, count(id)
   	FROM films
   	GROUP BY genre
   	ORDER BY count DESC;
   ```

   

10. Write a SQL query that will return the following data:

    ```psql
     decade |   genre   |                  films
    --------+-----------+------------------------------------------
       1940 | drama     | Casablanca

       2000 | horror    | 28 Days Later
       2010 | espionage | Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
       2010 | scifi     | Midnight Special, Interstellar, Godzilla
    (13 rows)
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT (year / 10 * 10) AS decade, genre, string_agg(title, ', ') AS films
    	FROM films
    	GROUP BY decade, genre
    	ORDER BY decade;
    ```

    

11. Write a SQL query that will return the following data:

    

    ```psql
       genre   | total_duration
    -----------+----------------
