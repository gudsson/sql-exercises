   	FROM countries
   	WHERE name = 'USA';
   ```

   

2. Write a query to return the population and the capital (with the columns in that order) of all the countries in the table.

   ```sql
   SELECT population, capital
   	FROM countries;
   ```

   

3. Write a query to return the names of all the countries ordered alphabetically.

   ```sql
   SELECT name
   	FROM countries
   	ORDER BY name;
   ```

   

4. Write a query to return the names and the capitals of all the countries in order of population, from lowest to highest.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, capital
   	FROM countries
   	ORDER BY population;
   ```

   

5. Write a query to return the same information as the previous query, but ordered from highest to lowest.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, capital
   	FROM countries
   	ORDER BY population DESC;
   ```

   

6. Write a query on the `animals` table, using `ORDER BY`, that will return the following output:

   ```sql
          name       |      binomial_name       | max_weight_kg | max_age_years
   ------------------+--------------------------+---------------+---------------
    Peregrine Falcon | Falco Peregrinus         |        1.5000 |            15
    Pigeon           | Columbidae Columbiformes |        2.0000 |            15
    Dove             | Columbidae Columbiformes |        2.0000 |            15
    Golden Eagle     | Aquila Chrysaetos        |        6.3500 |            24
    Kakapo           | Strigops habroptila      |        4.0000 |            60
   (5 rows)
   ```

   Use only the columns that can be seen in the above output for ordering purposes.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, binomial_name, max_weight_kg, max_age_years FROM animals
   	ORDER BY max_age_years, max_weight_kg, name DESC;
   ```
